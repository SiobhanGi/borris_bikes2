# Boris Bikes

Building a programme that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on)



An OOP ruby programme built by TDD and pair programming. 

The programme emulates the Boris bike docking system. You can publically store, and release bikes from the docking station. Report broken bikes and be confident knowing you won't get a broken bike. And the maintance staff can set the storage capacity of the docking station.
